# TeleCore

TeleCore started as a personal collection of tools and features I've created for my main mod TiberiumRim, made publicly
available via this separate framework mod!
It adds a lot of sophisticated and advanced features to extend RimWorld, from custom animations to new render options
and custom turrets! Alongside many, many tools and utilities.

## Getting Started

First of all make sure you add this mod as a dependency in your About.xml!
